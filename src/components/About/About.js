        In October of 2016 we purchased Furry Tales from the previous owner. We
        opened as 29 Paws Pet Grooming October 25, 2016. We will continue
        Nikki's tradition of providing a place of comfort for pets and their
        owners in Twentynine Palms.
      </p>
      <p className="about-two">
        We have lived in 29 Palms as “weekend residents” since 2010. Full time
        residents since August 2016. Since we love living in 29 Palms, we
        changed the name to 29 Paws to identify with our new town and show how
        proud we are to live and work in the community.
